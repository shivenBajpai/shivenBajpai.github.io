<h3>I'm Shiven Bajpai, a passionate high school student-developer from India</h3>

I am currently trying out all sorts of different things to find fields that interest me,
So far I've worked on

- A multiplayer remake of a classic video game, [(Slay)](https://github.com/shivenBajpai/Slay){:target="_blank"}
- Backend Web development roles for the platform for an inter-school event called de(c)ypher in my former school DPS Bhopal
- Some Frontend web development for a different blog site that ultimately fell apart before it was finished (Sigh...)
- Discord Bot development and web scrapers in JS

And im now working on trying to make a utility for pixel art designers called ACAS
as well as dabbling around in 3D graphics programming with OpenGL

You can follow my work here and on [Github](https://github.com/shivenBajpai)
